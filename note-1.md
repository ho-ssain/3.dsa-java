## Data Structure

What is Data Structure? Why we need it?

- Data structure is a way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and manipulated efficiently.
- After organizing data it becomes easy to process it

## Types of DS

1. Linear -: this type of structure contains elements in a linear manner i.e., sequential manner one after another. and each members are connected to their previous and next members. and that's why it's easy to traverse them and implement them also. And usually the traversal is a single level. Some of the examples are:
   1. Array
   2. Linked list
   3. Stack
   4. Queue
2. Non-linear -: this type of structure contains elements in a non-linear manners meaning they are not connected with each other in a sequential one after another way. They are connected to different paths and they are multi-level and that's it takes time to traversal compare to linear structure. and it's not that easy to implement. examples-:
   1. Tree
   2. Graphs:
